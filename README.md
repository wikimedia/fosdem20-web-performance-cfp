# FOSDEM 2020 Call for Participation: Web Performance

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/) is a Free Software event that offers free software communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. It brings together 8000+ participants from all over the world. It is held in Brussels (Belgium). FOSDEM will take place during the weekend of February 1st-2nd 2020.

More details about the event can be found at https://fosdem.org/.

## Web Performance devroom

The Web Performance devroom will focus on ongoing open standards development and FLOSS projects that support Web Performance work.

The Web Performance field is driven by open standards (browser APIs, internet protocols) and relies on many FLOSS tools to monitor, analyse and improve performance.

Most conferences about this topic tend to focus on best practices and standards once theyâ€™ve been finalized, while the ongoing creation of standards and FLOSS tooling development is rarely talked about. The objective of this devroom is to bring focus to these critical areas that actually define the future of the Web Performance field.

Suggested presentation topics:
- FLOSS tools to monitor, measure, analyse, optimize web performance
- Open standards (eg. HTTP/3, upcoming JS/HTML/CSS standards)
- Academic research on web performance
